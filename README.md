# GWT Modules BOM

This project contains "bill of materials" POM for GWT modules dependencies. For more on concept of BOMs, see:

* [The Bill of Materials in Maven](https://dzone.com/articles/the-bill-of-materials-in-maven)
* [Using Mavenâ€™s Bill of Materials (BOM)](https://reflectoring.io/maven-bom/)

But the basic idea is that instead of specifying version explicitly for every gwt modules component, as part of dependency definition, one can use a BOM to get a full, complete set of consistent versions to use.

## Status



## Usage

There are two ways to use the BOM pom: either as parent pom:

```xml
  <parent>
    <groupId>org.gwtproject</groupId>
    <artifactId>gwt-modules-bom</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-RC1</version>
  </parent>
```

or by importing the BOM to get versions via so-called "managed dependencies" (NOTE: BOM can NOT be used as an explicit dependency; it MUST be either parent pom or imported in `<dependencyManagement>` section)

```xml
  <dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.gwtproject</groupId>
        <artifactId>gwt-modules-bom</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0-RC1</version>
        <scope>import</scope>
        <type>pom</type>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>
  </dependencyManagement>
```

Two approaches are same with respect to dependency inclusion; latter ONLY includes dependencies, former includes many other settings. Usually latter is preferable, unless component is very closely coupled with core GWT modules components.

## Current Versions

This is a list of modules, and their versions contained in this BOM:

| Module                    | Version (Snapshot) | Version (Release) | Repo                                                                                                                                                              |

Keep in mind, that 1.0-SNAPSHOT will be the only version, that works with GWT 2.8.2 and Elemental2 1.0.0-RC1. All other versions **require GWT 2.9.0 and Elemental2 1.1.0** or newer.
